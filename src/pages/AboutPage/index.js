      Hi, everyone. I'm Misha, I'm 26, from Bulgaria and I'm currently enrolled
      in a coding bootcamp with the University of Birmingham. I moved to the UK
      for uni when I was 19 and I'm somehow still here. I studied Interior
      Design, but never did anything with my degree, other than keep it in the
      envelope it came in. I work as a waitress in a pub in Edgbaston. I started
      working there part-time when I was still in university and have now been
      there for over 3 years! That's a lot of pints I've poured and a lot of
      dogs I've pet!
